##Reflection

Although it was a bit repetitive, I enjoyed this lab because I feel like I have a much better understanding of how to set up a application skeleton in ruby on rails. After making a bog app 4 times I am also much more comfortable with the terminal commands and my debugging skills have improved as well. It was preeeetty repetitive though, it might have been fun to do 4 slightly different but very closely related apps instead of the exact same one. Also, while I know we can add in bootstrap or other front end frameworks I didn't do any of that as I was just trying to go for speed but that was a lot of fun to add the timed aspect of app building into the mix.


## Tips

Play around a bit with bog apps 2, 3 as that will break some things and give you a better understanding of what rails and ruby are doing behind the scenes. I wish I had done this more and will probably go back and do more now that I'm done. I also broke the app up into chunks when I was comfortable with what I was doing and that helped bring the time down. Also I highly recommend trying your best to not rely on the instructions or other versions of the app as the instructions say.


## Times

First Run: Wasn't very diligent about timing this one, but it probably took an hour at least and probably more like 90 mins

Last Run: Start to finish was 34 minutes including time for testing and troubleshooting
